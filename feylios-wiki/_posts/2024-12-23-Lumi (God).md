Lumi ♂ - Spirit Domain: (House) Personal Domains: (Light), (Purity), (Righteousness) 
Son of Thantos to a mortal woman of Kania since Lillet has gone is revered as the god of light and purity, who is described to be a full armored man on a lightly armored horse. He carries a lance and his eyes shine from beneath his helm-covered face. Lumi bestows visions upon those he sees with the potential to become his worshippers. He shows them visions of a world without monsters, without suffering, without wars. He whispers /the world is not as it should be. Take up my cause and rectify that/ Those who take up Lumi's cause feel more and more righteous with each evil plan they thwart, each tyrant they take down and each evil beast they defeat.
